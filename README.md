# PacmanAnimation
A funny pacman animation, might be relaxing to see...

This animation was done as an excercise for the fullstack developer program bootcamp.

#How does it works
You can change the size of the window to any size you want and the pacman will always turn it's direction when it reaches the border of the window.

#How to use it
To run the programm just drop the html file in your browser and enjoy the animation!!
